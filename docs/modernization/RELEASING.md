# Releasing, versioning and F-Droid

## How F-Droid ships OneShot

The F-Droid recipe [`metadata/de.ptrlx.oneshot.yml`](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/blob/master/metadata/de.ptrlx.oneshot.yml) (as of v1.1.1):

```yaml
RepoType: git
Repo: https://github.com/ptrLx/OneShot.git
Binaries: https://github.com/ptrLx/OneShot/releases/download/v%v/OneShot.apk
Builds:
  - versionName: 1.1.1
    versionCode: 111
    commit: a3f3b358fe56ac73b25b7810595004d7a7ba2140
    subdir: app
    gradle:
      - yes
AllowedAPKSigningKeys: 511c8933704278f936183c54ef963b9b66a0f6c232adca17bb52090f62b80456
AutoUpdateMode: Version
UpdateCheckMode: Tags
```

What this means for us:

1. **Discovery:** `checkupdates` scans the git tags of ptrLx/OneShot, reads `versionCode` and `versionName` from `app/build.gradle(.kts)` at each tag with regular expressions, and picks the highest versionCode. Keep both as plain literals in the app build file (not in a version catalog, not computed). Only push `vX.Y.Z` tags upstream; any other tag is scanned too.
2. **Build:** F-Droid copies the previous build block, sets `commit` to the new tag and runs `gradle assembleRelease` in `app/` on its buildserver, today **Debian trixie with the default OpenJDK 21** (fdroidserver `buildserver/Dockerfile`, no `sudo:` override in our recipe). It uses the Gradle version of our wrapper and scans the source for proprietary dependencies and binaries.
3. **Reproducibility:** F-Droid downloads `OneShot.apk` from the GitHub release `v<versionName>`, copies its signature onto its own unsigned build (`apksigcopier`) and publishes our signed APK only if the result verifies. Any byte difference blocks the update. The signature must be from the key in `AllowedAPKSigningKeys`.
4. **Tag = built commit.** The tag must point at exactly the commit the release APK was built from. History shows why: tag `v1.1.1` points to `319fba1`, but the published APK and the F-Droid recipe are from `a3f3b35` (baseline profile sort fix added after tagging), so the recipe needed a hand-edited `commit:`. release-please tags the release commit and the release job builds that tag, which rules this out. `reproduce-release.yml` verified on 2026-10-04 that `a3f3b35` rebuilt in `debian:bullseye` with OpenJDK 11 matches the published v1.1.1 `OneShot.apk`.
5. **Changelog:** F-Droid shows `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/changelogs/<versionCode>.txt` (max 500 characters). Descriptions, icon and screenshots come from `fastlane/metadata/android/`.

## Versioning with release-please

- Every change lands on `master` as a squash commit whose message is the conventional-commit PR title (`feat:` gives a minor bump, `fix:` a patch bump, `feat!:`/`BREAKING CHANGE` a major bump; `build:`, `ci:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:` do not release and are hidden in the changelog).
- `release.yml` runs release-please on every push to `master`. It keeps one release PR open (`chore: release X.Y.Z`) that updates `CHANGELOG.md`, `.release-please-manifest.json` and `versionName` in `app/build.gradle` (line marked `// x-release-please-version`).
- The same workflow runs `scripts/release/sync_version.py` on the release PR branch: it sets `versionCode = MAJOR*10000 + MINOR*100 + PATCH` (1.2.0 is 10200, larger than the legacy 111) and writes the F-Droid changelog file for that versionCode. The script refuses to lower the versionCode.
- Configuration: `release-please-config.json` (`release-type: simple`, `include-component-in-tag: false`, so tags are `vX.Y.Z`).

## Builds

| Trigger | Output | Signing |
|---|---|---|
| Pull request | debug APK + unsigned release APK as workflow artifacts | debug key / none |
| Push to `master` (nightly) | same artifacts for every master commit | debug key / none |
| Release PR merged (upstream) | `OneShot.apk` attached to the GitHub release `vX.Y.Z` | upstream release key from the `release` environment |
| Manual run of `sign-release.yml` (rehearsal) | signed `OneShot.apk` as a workflow artifact, nothing published | upstream release key from the `release` environment |

The release APK is built by the reusable workflow `sign-release.yml` in two jobs. The **build** job uses the same Debian container and JDK as the CI reproducibility job (which mirrors the F-Droid buildserver), checks versionCode against the tag and runs the APK checks; it has no access to the key. The **sign** job runs in the protected `release` environment, never checks out or runs repository code, signs the unsigned artifact with `apksigner` without zipalign (F-Droid must be able to transplant the signature onto its own build), fails unless the APK has exactly one signer whose certificate SHA-256 is the `AllowedAPKSigningKeys` value, and checks the transplant with `apksigcopier compare`. `release.yml` then uploads the APK under the fixed asset name `OneShot.apk`. `reproduce-release.yml` can re-verify any published release from source.

## Signing setup (`release` environment)

The release key is stored only as secrets of a GitHub **environment** named `release` (Settings, Environments), never as repository secrets, so no other workflow or job can read it.

| Name | Kind | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | environment secret | `base64 -w0` of the keystore (JKS or PKCS12) holding the key behind `AllowedAPKSigningKeys` |
| `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | environment secret | keystore password |
| `RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS` | environment secret | alias of the signing key |
| `RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD` | environment secret | key password (same as the keystore password for PKCS12) |
| `RELEASE_CERT_SHA256` | environment variable, optional | expected signer certificate SHA-256; only needed for a test key, defaults to `511c8933…0456` |
| `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` | repository secret, optional | fine-grained PAT (contents and pull requests: write) so CI runs on release PRs; PRs opened with the default token do not trigger workflows |

Protection rules for the `release` environment:

- **Required reviewers:** the maintainer. Every signing run waits for approval, so nothing gets signed unnoticed. Approve promptly after merging a release PR: F-Droid may try to build as soon as it sees the tag, and fails while `OneShot.apk` is missing.
- **Deployment branches and tags:** selected branches, `master` only. Release builds run from `master` (`release.yml` builds the tag that release-please just created), so other branches can never reach the key.
- No wait timer, admins not allowed to bypass.

Check the key locally before storing it: `keytool -list -v -keystore <file>` must show the alias with certificate SHA-256 `51:1C:89:33:…:04:56`.

**Rehearsal:** start `sign-release.yml` manually from `master` (`make release-rehearsal`, optionally `REF=<tag or commit>`), approve the run, and download the signed `OneShot.apk` artifact. It proves that the secrets, the alias and the fingerprint are right without creating a release. The fork has no release key; its release PRs only validate the automation and are not merged.

## Rules that keep F-Droid green

- Toolchain changes go together: wrapper Gradle version, CI JDK, Debian image of the reproducibility and release jobs. They must match what the F-Droid buildserver uses (#26).
- With AGP 8 or newer: `dependenciesInfo { includeInApk = false; includeInBundle = false }` and `vcsInfo { include = false }`.
- Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`) opens grouped weekly updates as `build(deps)` and `ci(deps)` PRs, which never trigger a release. Major updates of the Android Gradle plugin and Kotlin are ignored there and done by hand, together with the CI containers. The Gradle wrapper is also updated by hand, after checking which Gradle version the F-Droid buildserver supports.
- No proprietary libraries (Google Play services, Firebase, Crashlytics), no prebuilt binaries in the repository except the validated Gradle wrapper jar, no toolchain auto-download.
- Kotlin Multiplatform: iOS targets must not be configured on Linux builds unless explicitly enabled (#44), so the F-Droid build never downloads Kotlin/Native.
- After the first release from the new pipeline, watch the F-Droid build log (monitor.f-droid.org) and, if the recipe needs changes, open a merge request on fdroiddata.

## Upstream handover

Tracked in #19: create the `release` environment with its secrets and protection rules (see above) and run a signing rehearsal, enable Actions and "Allow GitHub Actions to create pull requests", set squash-only merges with the PR title as commit message, merge the fork's `master`, let release-please open the first release PR, merge it, and verify the published `OneShot.apk` with `reproduce-release.yml` before F-Droid picks it up.
